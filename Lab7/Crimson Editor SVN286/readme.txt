[CRIMSON EDITOR]

  Crimson Editor is a professional source editor for Windows.

  This program is not only fast in loading time,
  but also small in size (so small that it can be copied in one floppy disk).

  While it can serve as a good replacement for Notepad,
  it also offers many powerful features for programming languages
  such as HTML, C/C++, Perl, and Java.

  Crimson Editor is now being developed by the Emerald Editor team.  Visit
  the Emerald Editor homepage at http://www.emeraldeditor.com for new updates.
